# Infinite BSOD Simulation

This is a fun and harmless web-based simulation that mimics a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD). Once started, it rapidly descends into chaos with static sounds, screen shakes, glitching visuals, fake QR codes, and a retro-style final message.

## Features

- Realistic glitching effects and screen flashing
- Static noise and buzzing audio
- Fake BSOD with a humorous twist
- "Installation" progress bar just to mess with you
- QR codes that link to a Rickroll
- Final screen displays “YOUR COMPUTER HAS BEEN FUCKED. :)”
- Optional exit via button or pressing `Escape` key

## How to Run

1. Download the `infiniteBSOD.html` file.
2. Open it in any modern web browser.
3. Click the **START CHAOS???** button to begin the madness.
4. Press `Escape` or click the **EXIT** button at any time to stop the simulation.

## Notes

- **This does not harm your computer.** It's just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- No files are downloaded or installed.
- All sounds and effects are web-based and temporary.
